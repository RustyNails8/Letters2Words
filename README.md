## Welcome to SD Projects

I use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RustyNails8/SAPonAIXandOracle/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
