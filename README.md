## Welcome to SD Projects

I use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RustyNails8/SAPonAIXandOracle/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## PreRequisites:
1. CPP complier g++. Get from [HERE](https://filehippo.com/download_dev-c/)
2. Python Interpreter version 3.7. Get from [HERE](https://www.python.org/)
3. Install the enchant Python PyPi Package. Get from [HERE](https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/)

1. Run the 3-RunMe.cmd with the letters as arguments
2. Your possible words would be displayed rightaway
3. Additinally 2 more files like WORDS.exe and WORD.TXT are created.

- ** Remove g++ compile step after first run ** 
- ** ONLY remove/comment this line from 3-RunMe.cmd file AFTER you have 1 SUCCESSFUL run of 3-RunMe.cmd **

```batch script ahead
```

```batch
REM Complie your CPP program
REM You can remove this once the WORDS.exe file is created

```

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RustyNails8/SAPonAIXandOracle/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
